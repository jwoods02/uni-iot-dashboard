### Working Agreement

As a team we agree that we will attend every teaching session. Any absence will be explained on the MS Teams group. Any communication outside of teaching hours will be done publicly in the MS Teams group so that every team member is up to date on all information.

We will be working as an Agile Kanban team, this means that although planning will be done weekly, we do not need to commit to weekly goals and ensure all work is completed in sprints. As a result, we will need to be vigilant that the backlog stays up to date, and in order.

The units of work we are using are user stories. These will describe the feature being developed, with acceptance criteria to ensure testability of each story for the developed and code reviewer.

To develop user stories, we will be using a modified git flow technique. Every release will be a commit in the master branch. Development of a new release happens in the develop branch. Every story will have a feature branch with a descriptive name of the feature.

When a user story is completed and fully unit tested, a merge request into develop will be generated for this feature branch. The developer will assign a team member to code review each merge request. The minimum code review will include checking out the branch and ensuring all functionality works as expected locally as well as checking the lines of code that have changed to ensure the code is clean, descriptive and uses modern JS features.
